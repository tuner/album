Really Simple Album Script
==========================

(c) Kari Lavikka

Most picture galleries are quite complex and require components like PHP
and MySQL. I wanted something really simple that just creates thumbnails
and a static HTML page with some pretty javascript eye candy. Here it is.

An example of an album created with this script:
http://tuner.bdb.fi/gfx/valokuvat/syksyrapsyja/

Usage:

1) As this is just my personal quick hack, you must first edit thumbs.sh
   and configure hard coded settings like copyright notice and thumbnail size.

2) Ensure that ImageMagick can be found from the path

3) Run the script in a directory that contains your pictures. An index.html and
   thumbs/ directory with new thumbnails will be created. After that, copy
   thumbs.css and thumbs.js somewhere and ensure that paths are correct in
   the index.html.


TODO:
* A configuration file instead of hard coded values
* Some error checking
* Intelligent handling for piture captions
